Tell me about your business. (History, values, location, future plans, current revenue.)



What products do you sell, and what are their details? (We sell coffee by pounds, and we sell coffe grinders. We have a total of 27 different coffees we sell.)



How automated do you want this? (Want to have orders automatically emailed to you when ordered, or do you want to log in to an admin page to see what the orders are current?)



Will you want an admin page to track revenue, traffic, and change items/price.



What is your companies revenue, what is your companies monthly order number, how many of those are repeats, and are you expecting to have major growth in the next two years. This will determine things like databse and hosing size. Can be changed later on if big business boom happens.



Will you want me to maintin it, or would you want to maintain it?
Plus of developer maintaining website: Near-immediate bug and crash fixes. Cheaper Price point up front Help maintain practically all aspects of website when needed.
Minus of developer maintaining website: Developer fee of 250-500 a month.
Plus of owner maintaining website: No monthly fees beside database, hosting, ect. Direct work, maintanence, and vision with website.
Minus of owner maintaining website: More expensive cost up front. If anything breaks, or if databse/hosting becomes overfilled/too slow, it will be up to owner to hire a developer to fix website.

How fast do you want this completed? The sooner you need the website, the more expensive it will be. And will you want a second developer to help speed up the proccess? If so, I can always recommend some people i went to school with who have fantastic resmues as well.
